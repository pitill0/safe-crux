[releases]

  - new version numbers more similar to CRUX's releases:
    2.7.0 for the first version running CRUX 2.7
    2.7.1 for next patch or feature for CRUX 2.7
    2.7.2 for the next one
    ...
    2.8.0 for the first version running CRUX 2.8
    ...

[safe-env]

  - use $MNT_DIR/$IMG_NAME instead of $MNT_DIR for being able to run
    more than one safe-env (due to 2.7.1) ***DONE***

  - optionally use one directory instead of an image (due to 2.7.2)


[documentation]

  - add more contents and info to the README file

  - write more documents:
    - howto get running your first safe-env, options, etc.
    - howto fast developing ports inside the safe environment

  - improve man files for safe-env and prt-clean

  - write a skeleton file for HOWTO's


[installation]

  - create a Makefile for installations like this: (due to 2.7.1) ***WORK IN PROGRESS***

    /usr/bin/cse -> /usr/bin/safe-env (alias: Crux Safe Environment)
    /usr/bin/safe-env
    /usr/etc/safe-env.conf
    /usr/man/man8/safe-env.8.gz
    /usr/share/safe-env/bin/*
    /usr/share/safe-env/doc/*
    /usr/share/safe-env/addons/*

    from the script we should try to read first the user config file
    which is an overlay for configuration variables:
    ~/.safe-env.conf

    and also the first time we must to create all required directories:
    ~/.safe-env/mnt
    ~/.safe-env/iso
    ~/.safe-env/img
    ~/.safe-env/doc
