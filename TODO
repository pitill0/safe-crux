[releases]

  - new version numbers more similar to CRUX's releases:
    2.7.0 for the first version running CRUX 2.7
    2.7.1 for next patch or feature for CRUX 2.7
    2.7.2 for the next one
    ...
    2.8.0 for the first version running CRUX 2.8
    ...

[safe-crux]

  - be possible to pass commands directly to safe-crux, like:
    $ safe-crux use /dev/sdb1 prt-get sysup

  - implement 'list' command to get a list of available safe-crux's targets
    this list must contain safe-crux's images stored in IMGDIR
    $ safe-crux list
    crux-2.6
    crux-2.7
    crux-2.7-devel
    crux-2.7-xfce

  - for the future we could implement more features to 'list' command:
    - use a data file containing all the targets that success to call
      safe-crux with 'use' command
    - check the path to every target and discard if not exists
    - to avoid that data file grows a lot we can use a config var like
      DATASIZE=100 # number of target lines stored in data file
    $ safe-crux list
    crux-2.6
    crux-2.7
    crux-2.7-devel
    crux-2.7-xfce
    /dev/sdb1
    /home/sepen/crux-newglibc-test
    /srv/backup/safe-crux-images/lenovo-2.6.39.1

  - write a bash_completion file
