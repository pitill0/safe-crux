    ...

[safe-crux]

  - optionally use one directory instead of an image


[documentation]

  - add more contents and info to the README file

  - write more documents:
    - howto get running your first safe-crux, options, etc.
    - howto fast developing ports inside the safe environment

  - improve man files for safe-crux and prt-clean

  - write a skeleton file for HOWTO's


[installation]

  - create a Makefile for installations like this: (due to 2.7.3) ***WORK IN PROGRESS***

    /usr/bin/safe-crux
    /usr/etc/safe-crux.conf
    /usr/man/man8/safe-crux.8.gz
    /usr/share/safe-crux/bin/*
    /usr/share/safe-crux/doc/*
    /usr/share/safe-crux/addons/*

    from the script we should try to read first the user config file
    which is an overlay for configuration variables:
    ~/.safe-crux.conf

    and also the first time we must to create all required directories:
    ~/.safe-crux/mnt
    ~/.safe-crux/iso
    ~/.safe-crux/img
