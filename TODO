[safe-crux]

  - simplify setup process by removing iso download section. if we let the
    user to download and check the md5 of the iso, then we saved a lot of
    logic especially during the loading phase of configuration variables

    example:
    $ scx setup --iso=~/Downloads/crux-3.2.iso --target=/mnt

    that will require to refactor some pieces of code which use ISO_VERSION
    variable

  - integrate upstream setup script
    - flag to avoid copy kernel sources
    - fix stuff copied from host (resolv.conf, etc.)
    - pass size for mkimage as argument since setup will require more/less
      space to finish without errors (kernel its copied during install)

  - write a bash_completion file


[documentation]

  - add more contents and info to the README file

  - write more documents:
    - howto get running your first safe-crux, options, etc.
    - howto fast developing ports inside the safe environment

  - improve man files for safe-crux and prt-clean

  - write a skeleton file for HOWTO's
