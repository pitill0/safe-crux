[safe-crux]

  - fix issue for more than one session in concurrency of the same target

    - after a session is started for a target, the second one, and next ones
      must check if there is already a running session, that means to check
      for mounted partitions
      $ safe-crux use /dev/sda2
      + Mounting target /dev/sda2 ...
      mount: /dev/sda2 already mounted or /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2 busy
      mount: according to mtab, /dev/sda2 is already mounted on /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2

    - also before exit from a session, it must check for running sessions
      before trying to umount partitions like proc, sys, dev, ...
      # exit
      exit
      + Unmounting target /dev/sda2 ...
      umount: /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2: device is busy.
          (In some cases useful info about processes that use
           the device is found by lsof(8) or fuser(1))
      anyways it tries to umount all mounted partitions like proc, sys, dev, ...
      so later, when the last session ends you'll have a not clean scenario
      # exit
      exit
      umount: /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2/dev/pts: not found
      umount: /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2/tmp: not mounted
      umount: /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2/sys: not mounted
      umount: /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2/proc: not mounted
      umount: /home/sepen/.safe-crux/mnt/sda2/dev: not mounted
      + Unmounting target /dev/sda2 ...

  - implement 'list' command to get a list of available safe-crux's targets
    this list must contain safe-crux's images stored in IMGDIR

  - write a bash_completion file


[documentation]

  - add more contents and info to the README file

  - write more documents:
    - howto get running your first safe-crux, options, etc.
    - howto fast developing ports inside the safe environment

  - improve man files for safe-crux and prt-clean

  - write a skeleton file for HOWTO's
