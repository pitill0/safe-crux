HOWTO - Resize your image


Some filesystem require that the filesystem to resize is not mounted
before start the resize procedure.
$ sudo umount mnt/

Also you should check the filesystem integrity for the image
$ sudo /sbin/e2fsck -f img/core



Then you can resize the image depending on the filesystem:


  EXT2/EXT3/EXT4

    Unless you have patched your kernel with the ext2online patch it is
    necessary to unmount the file system before resizing it.
    $ sudo /sbin/resize2fs img/core 2G

    And if you want to shrink the filesystem to its minimum size
    $ sudo /sbin/resize2fs -M img/core

    On Centos5 (and maybe others) you should use resize4fs for -M option
    Versions are:
      resize2fs: 1.39
      resize4fs: 1.41.9


  REISERFS

    Reiserfs file systems can be resized when mounted or unmounted as you prefer:
    $ sudo resize_reiserfs img/core


  XFS

    XFS file systems must be mounted to be resized and the mount-point is specified
    rather than the device name.
    $ sudo xfs_growfs mnt/


  JFS

    Like XFS, file system must be mounted to be resized and the mount-point
    is specified rather than the device name.

    You need at least Version 1.0.21 of the jfs-utils to do this.
    $ sudo mount -o remount,resize mnt/

    Some kernel versions have problems with this syntax (2.6.0 is known to have
    this problem). In this case you have to explicitly specify the new size of
    the filesystem in blocks. This is extremely error prone as you must know the
    blocksize of your filesystem and calculate the new size based on those units.
    Example: If you were to resize a JFS file system to 4 gigabytes that has 4k
    blocks, you would write:
    $ sudo mount -o remount,resize=1048576 mnt/
